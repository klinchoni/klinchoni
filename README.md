- 👩‍💻 About Me
- 🎓 I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Information Technologies from the University of Plovdiv "Paisii Hilendarski".
💻 I also completed a professional diploma program at SoftUni as a Back-End Software Engineer with C#, where I gained hands-on experience in building robust and scalable web applications.


I’m a dedicated and detail-oriented software developer with a strong background in both business and technology. I studied Business Information Technologies at Plovdiv University "Paisii Hilendarski", while simultaneously completing the Back-End Software Engineer with C# diploma program at SoftUni.

🚀 Studying in parallel allowed me to combine academic knowledge with practical, project-based learning. At SoftUni, I gained hands-on experience in designing, developing, and maintaining modern web applications using:

C# / .NET Core

Entity Framework

MS SQL Server

RESTful APIs

ASP.NET MVC / Web API

LINQ, OOP, and Design Patterns

🛠️ I enjoy solving real-world problems with clean, efficient code and continuously learning new technologies. I’m particularly passionate about building scalable back-end systems and working with databases.

📂 On this GitHub profile, you’ll find some of my projects and experiments — from coursework to personal ideas I’ve brought to life.

🌱 Currently, I’m focused on expanding my knowledge in cloud technologies, system design, and DevOps tools.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love staying on my PC for hours and sometimes for days.
- 👩🏽‍🍼 I am a mom of a 1 year old baby boy.
